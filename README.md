# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Processing Engine using Kafka - Data Engineering Project

## Introduction 
 I successfully executed an end-to-end project on real-time stock market data analysis. Utilizing a combination of technologies including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL, I was able to develop a simulation app that generated a live stream of data from a csv file, stored it as individual files in an AWS S3 bucket, and queried the data using AWS in-house tools such as Glue Crawler and Athena.

## What did i learn?

Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in various aspects of data engineering, including real-time data processing, data storage, and data querying. I honed my skills in using technologies such as Python, AWS, Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL, and learned how to effectively integrate them to build a complete end-to-end solution. Additionally, I developed my ability to troubleshoot and overcome technical challenges, further strengthening my problem-solving skills. Overall, this project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in real-time data analysis and reinforced my commitment to continuously improving my skills as a data engineer.
